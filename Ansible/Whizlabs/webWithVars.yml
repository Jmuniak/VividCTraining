--- ##### Bootstrap Webservers #####
- hosts: webservers ### Group of hosts
  become: yes  ### sudo become user, by default, 'root' (equiv to -b in ad-hoc commands) this essentially puts sudo before everything we run in this playbook because these things will need elevated privilages
  
  tasks:
  - name:
    yum:
	    name: "{{ target_service }}"
		  state: latest

  - name: install httpd
    yum:
	    name: httpd
		  state: latest

  - name: create index.html file
    file:
	    name: /var/www/html/index.html
		  state: touch

  - name: add web content
    lineinfile:
	    line: "here is some text"
		  path: /var/www/html/index.html

  - name: start httpd
    service:
	    name: "{{ target_service }}"  ### name of the service
		  state: started
### AD-HOC cmd to assign variables 
# -e flag to assign variables, it takes its argument in double quotes: `$ asnible-playbook -i inv web.yml -e "target_service=httpd"
### so when we execute this playbook: its going to run against all servers in the webservers group as defined by ansible, 
#### its going to execute all the tasks using sudo which will be: 
##### 1. install httpd, 2. create index.html file, 3. put some text in that file, 4. and finally start the httpd service
