 # Sample YAML FILE
 # YAML supports multiple docs, and compliant parsers will recognize each set of dashes as the beginning of a new document. The separation of documents in YAML is denoted by three dashes (---). 
 # The end of document is represented with three dots (â€¦).

 # key value pairs
 # YAML is case sensitive
 doe: "a deer, a female deer" # String
 ray: 'a drop of golden sun' # can be enclosed in single or double quotes or no quotes at all.
 # YAML recognizes unquoted numerals as integers or floating point. 
 pi: 3.14159 # floating-point num
 xmas: true # Bool
 french-hens: 3 # Integer
 calling-birds: # Array denoted by dashes in list form, 2 space indent
   - huey
   - dewey
   - louie
   - fred
 calling-birds: ["huey", "dewey", "louie", "fred"] # Array denoted in a single line
 xmas-fifth-day:
   calling-birds: four
   french-hens: 3
   golden-rings: 5
   partridges:
     count: 1
     location: "a pear tree"
   turtle-doves: two
